How to setup docker credential-store in Ubuntu

Modified on a blog: https://ovaar.github.io/blog/how-to-setup-docker-credential-store/


Since docker version 19 it start notifying the user that the docker credentials are stored unencrypted.

WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted â€¦
To solve this we will use the Docker credential-store feature.

Ubuntu: docker-credential-pass
OSX: osxkeychain
Windows: wincred
In this blog post we are going to use install the latest docker-credential-pass helper in combination with pass as a store and gpg2 for key generation.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y pass gpg gnupg2
gpg2 --gen-key
# copy gpg public key to clipboard for the next command run: pass init

pass init "<gpg-pub-key>"   #use the copied public key to replace "<gpg-pub-key>"

sed -i '0,/{/s/{/{\n\t"credsStore": "pass",/' ~/.docker/config.json  ## modify ~/.docker/config.json file

The following one-line will download the latest docker-credential-pass helper from github and 
extract it to the ~/bin directory:

sudo curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://api.github.com/repos/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases/latest | \
     xargs curl -s | grep -o -P "https.*docker-credential-pass.*linux-amd64" | wget -qi - && \
     mkdir -p ~/usr/bin && mv docker-credential-pass-v*-amd64. ~/usr/bin/docker-credential-pass
     
Finally, login with your docker credentials. 
If you have logged in using other insecure method, run docker logout first.
